Its Very very improtant to note that after you first upload the code to the esp8266 you have to commnet 
rtc.adjust(DateTime(F(__DATE__),F(__TIME__)));
or else it will keep reseting after boot


Also for ESP01 you have to change wire.begin(2,0); if you forgot to do this esp01 will not recognize the output pins
